1- For the refactoring problem i chose to divide the code to modules in different .py files when in need of one of them we just call the needed fucntion:
to generate recommendations we simply tap this line of command:
python3 get_recommendation.py [user_id] 
2- for the evaluation, it was not an easy task for me, in order to evalute the model we can compute RMSE or MSE between the similarity and the 
ratings of the recommended  movies for a certain user but the ground truth data is not available..
3-Looking at the problem in the first time and analysing its parts, please allow my critical thinking to talk, at first I saw that in certains cases the code can recommand to some users movies that they already watched it which is not really AI, because we need to recommend new movies for people.
4-I can say also that we missed a very important task treating the project, we had a huge diversified but while recommanding we didn't treat well our dataset, we could use Gender,zip code(place), age,... and much more other data to generate efficient recommendations to people. My point is, we should treat data with a statistical approch in order to know well about it and use its secrets.
5-I recommand in this occasion, a solution that i tried to work on during this test, which is a machine learning algroithm using k-means clustering algorithm using clusters would help having an efficient recommendation.
6-The test wasn't easy and it helped me discover how to imporve my skills and it give me to much learning opportunities, it was so much fun thought, i enjoyed dealing with it and it helped me to shape my analytical skills and my critical thinking, which is something important in a data scientist and a MLE, i am sure of my ability to improve my technical skills with yoy and my motication to achieve success in an internship position at your company.
Finally, i congratulate you for this amazing work and i am looking forward to hearing from you.
